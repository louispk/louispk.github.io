    description: This research project concerned itself with the current state of internet censorship in the United Kingdom. Over  the  last  two  decades,the  government  of  the     United  Kingdom  has  introduced  a number  of  policies  to  restrict  access  to  certain  types  of  content on  the  internet. The  goals  and  legal  foundations for         these  policies were described, and  the  extent  of  censorship  in  the UK   illustrated  by  analysing data  from  Internet  censorship measurements,   provided   by   OONI     and   the   Blocked   project. The paper can be found <a href="https://louispk.github.io/assets/Internet_censorship_UK.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

    description: GPT-2 is well known for its text-creation prowess as well as zero-shot capabilities. In this work, Asmir Muminovic and I implemented a binary and multi-class classification head for GPT-2 and trained it upon a dataset containing medical abstracts. With trained parameters, we were able to achieve impressive zero-shot results in both binary and multi-classification tasks, with the results being constrained due to a lack of capable hardware.
